### To do
* Bug in v_blank.asm line 54, brick_present not offseted with X.
* Ball can bounce and kill bricks (in progress, delayed)
* Consistent memory usage: Minimize use of the tmp variables (it's getting messy), use local variables (in progress).
* Convention enforcement.
* Fix inconsistent and misleading names, some problems are pointed out in documentation.
