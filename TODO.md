### To do
* Fix speed increase token bug: ball does not stop on roof.
* Fix screen bugs
    * Upper left corner BG tile
* ball_placement and move_token contains identical code. Move into common lib routine.
* Ball can bounce and kill bricks (in progress, delayed)
* Consistent memory usage: Minimize use of the tmp variables (it's getting messy), use local variables (in progress).
* Convention enforcement.
* Fix inconsistent and misleading names, some problems are pointed out in documentation.
